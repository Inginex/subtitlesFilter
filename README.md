# Subtitle Manager

Subtitle Manager is an application to manage movie captions, series, anime, etc more efficiently. You can also download the captions directly to the application and organize them by categories.

The application is still in the testing phase and also does not have all the functions. This is a project for learning purposes only, I don't have the goal of turning it into something beyond that.

I appreciate any suggestions or tips to improve application performance or improve the code itself.

## Setup
If you want to change something in the code you can use: 
```
go get -u github.com/sampalm/subtitleManager.
```

Or you also can download the executable version **[Outdated]**.

## How to use

To use the application you must use flags to define directories and different functions of the application. For more information Use ```-h``` tag to see a detailed set of instructions explaining the main functions of the application.

###### Main flags
* ```-p``` Sets the main subtitle directory.
* ```-e``` Sets the file extension, usually ".srt".
* ```-v``` Sets the subtitle version, like "iNTERNAL.480p.x264".
