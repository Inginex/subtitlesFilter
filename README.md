===

SubtitlesFilter can make your life more easier by selecting only the subtitles you need to watch your movies, series or whatever you want.

## Setup
If you want to change something in the code you can use: 
```
go get -u github.com/Inginex/subtitlesFilter
```

Or you also can download the executable version.

## How to use

Put the address where your subtitles are and after that just enter the version of the subtitle you want, after the program finish the task your subtitles will be in the backup folder that will be created automatically. Enjoy ;) 
*OBS: This program will delete all subtitles that are in the "path" and do not match with your "version", so be aware of that.
